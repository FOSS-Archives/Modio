An open source desktop application designed to easily browse through a regularly updated database of mods, game saves, homebrew, resources, themes and much more for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A library that is populated by myself, few friends and awesome contributors, so that all mods have been tested and verified. ModioX also acts as an FTP client to be able to install and uninstall directly to your console. Without the need for digging up old threads or using file managers - this aims to do everything for you.

**the only one of its kind...**

### Translations
Translating the app into your own language has never been easier. The project makes use of a powerful online tool called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) to help manage translations and updates made to the app.

If you are already familiar with the Crowdin platform and want to contribute your time to translating a few strings, just head to the link below and get started!

For the localization process we use the collaborative platform from [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/), thanks to their generosity for providing a professional service to Open Source projects free of charge. Please read the [introduction for new translators](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/) and [guide for using the online editor](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/) to understand how it works.
